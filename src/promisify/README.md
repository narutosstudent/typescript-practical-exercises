**Function Scope and `this`:**

- In JavaScript, the value of `this` within a function depends on how the function is called, not where it's defined.
- When you define a function using the `function` keyword (a "regular" function), it has its own `this` context, which is set at the time of the function's invocation.
- If a regular function is defined inside another function, it doesn't automatically inherit the `this` context from its parent function. Instead, its `this` value depends on how it is called.
